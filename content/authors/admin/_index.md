I am a fifth year PhD student studying operations research at the University at Buffalo. I am a member of the Group for Applied Mathematical Modeling and Analytics ([GAMMA](https://researchgamma.com)), led by my advisor [Jose L. Walteros](http://engineering.buffalo.edu/industrial-systems/people/faculty-directory/walteros-jose.html). My research is focused on integer programming techniques for solving network interdiction and graph partitioning problems.
